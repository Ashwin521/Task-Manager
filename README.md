# Task Manager Backend

This is the backend for the Task Manager project built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**.

## Current Features

- MongoDB connection using Mongoose
- Express server setup with CORS and JSON parsing
- Routes for authentication:
  - `/api/auth/register` → register a new user
  - `/api/auth/login` → login an existing user

##  Note

> The login and register routes are **not functional yet**.  
> Currently, they are placeholders and do not fully handle authentication.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
